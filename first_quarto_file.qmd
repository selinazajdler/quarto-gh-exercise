## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll use WebR to perform a simple analysis of the `mtcars` and `mpg` datasets. You'll practice fitting a linear model and creating visualizations using `ggplot2`.

## Task 1: Linear Regression with `mtcars`

Fit a linear regression model that predicts **miles per gallon (`mpg`)** using **horsepower (`hp`)** from the `mtcars` dataset. Then interpret the results.

```{webr-r}
# Your code here: fit the model
model_hp <- lm(____ ~ ____, data = mtcars)

# View the summary
summary(model_hp)
```

**Questions:**

1. Is horsepower a statistically significant predictor of MPG?
2. What does the coefficient of `hp` tell you about its relationship with `mpg`?

## Task 2: Visualization with `mpg` Dataset

Create a scatter plot of **city MPG (`cty`)** vs. **engine displacement (`displ`)** using the `mpg` dataset. Color the points by the number of cylinders (`cyl`).

```{webr-r}
# Your code here: make the plot
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = ____, y = ____, color = ____)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "City MPG and Engine Displacement",
       subtitle = "Colored by number of cylinders")
```

**Questions:**

1. Describe the overall trend between `displ` and `cty`.
2. What does the color mapping tell you about the cylinder count and efficiency?

## Task 3 (Optional): Try Your Own Model

Explore the relationship between any two variables of your choice in `mtcars` or `mpg`. Fit a model or create a plot to explore the relationship. Include a brief interpretation of your findings.
